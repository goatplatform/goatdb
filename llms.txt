# GoatDB

> GoatDB is an edge‑native, distributed, schema‑based database designed for collaborative applications. It stores data in an append‑only, cryptographically signed commit graph, syncs in soft real‑time, works fully offline, and ships as a single executable.

GoatDB lets every client act as a replica and run low‑latency local queries while the database transparently merges and syncs changes in the background. The system provides versioned schemas, fine‑grained authorization rules, and React hooks for real‑time UIs.

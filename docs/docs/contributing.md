# Contributing to GoatDB

Your contributions power the next generation of collaborative applications. Every feature you add, bug you fix, and optimization you make helps developers worldwide build better real-time, offline-capable apps.

:::tip[Ready to Start?]
Check out our [Good First Issues](https://github.com/goatplatform/goatdb/labels/good%20first%20issue) to find your first contribution opportunity.
:::

## What You're Building

**Simplicity for Complex Problems**: Your code eliminates the complexity of custom sync servers, [conflict resolution](/docs/conflict-resolution), and state management that traditionally plague collaborative apps.

**Cutting-Edge Distributed Systems**: Work on [Bloom filter synchronization](/docs/sync), ephemeral [CRDTs](/docs/conflict-resolution), and [cryptographically signed commit graphs](/docs/commit-graph)â€”techniques pushing the boundaries of database design.

**Cross-Runtime Innovation**: Build features that work identically across [Deno, Node.js, and browsers](/docs/architecture#storage-model) with a single TypeScript codebase.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**: **Deno v2.4+** ([install here](https://deno.com/)) and **Node.js v24+** for [cross-runtime testing](/docs/architecture).

**AI-Enhanced Development**: GoatDB is optimized for AI-assisted development with [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code), [Cursor](https://cursor.com/), and [ChunkHound](https://github.com/ofriw/chunkhound).

**Setup**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/goatplatform/goatdb.git
cd goatdb

# Verify cross-platform functionality
deno task test   # Tests across Deno, Node.js, and browsers
deno task bench  # Performance validation
deno task build  # Compile optimizations

# Documentation site
deno task docs:serve  # Docusaurus docs server
```

## Testing & Performance

**Cross-Platform Testing**: Ensure your changes work identically across all runtimes:

```bash
# All platforms
deno task test

# Specific environments
deno task test --runtime=browser
deno task test --runtime=node
deno task test --suite=DB --test="conflict resolution"

# Debug mode
deno task test --debug --deno-inspect-brk
```

**Performance Validation**: Maintain GoatDB's real-time performance characteristics:

```bash
# Full benchmark suite
deno task bench

# Specific scenarios
deno task bench --benchmark="GoatDB Sync Protocol"
deno task bench --runtime=browser --headless
```

**Features**: Single-process debugging, real-world metrics (P95, P99), source map support across all platforms.

:::tip[Quality Gate]
Run `deno task test && deno task bench` before submitting to ensure no regressions.
:::

## Code Standards

**Formatting**: `deno fmt` (2 spaces, single quotes, 80 chars)
**Naming**: `camelCase` for variables, `PascalCase` for classes  
**Imports**: Use explicit `.ts` extensions
**Cross-platform**: Code must work identically on all target runtimes

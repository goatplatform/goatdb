# Server

A simple abstraction around an HTTP server. The server is built using two
primitives: endpoints and middlewares.

The generic parameter US defines the schema of User items throughout the
system. Pass your custom user schema to enable type-safe user management and
authorization. See @sessions.md and @authorization-rules.md for details on
user authentication and access control.

# Usage Examples

## 1. Standalone Server

```ts
import { Server } from './net/server/server.ts';

const server = new Server({
  // ...options
});

await server.start();
// The server now listens for HTTP requests on the default port (8080).
```

## 2. Integrating into an Existing Server

If you want to use GoatDB's server as a handler within another HTTP server,
you can call `await server.processRequest(request, info)` directly:

```ts
import { Server } from './net/server/server.ts';

const server = new Server({
  // ...options
});

// Inside your own HTTP server handler:
async function handler(request: Request) {
  const info = { // ...ServeHandlerInfo... };
  return await server.processRequest(request, info);
}

// Use `handler` in your custom server framework.
```

Endpoints:
----------
Endpoints are the core request handlers that process specific HTTP requests.
Each endpoint has a filter that determines which requests it handles, and a
processRequest method that generates the response. Endpoints are executed in
registration order until the first matching endpoint is found.

Middlewares:
-----------
Middlewares provide cross-cutting functionality that runs before and/or after
endpoint processing. They can:
- Block requests before they reach endpoints (e.g. for authentication)
- Modify responses after endpoints complete (e.g. adding headers)
- Log requests and responses
- Handle errors

All registered middlewares run for each request in registration order.

## Constructor

**<code>new Server(options: [ServerOptions](/docs/api/interfaces/serveroptions)&lt;US&gt;)</code>**

## Methods

### orgIds()

**<code>orgIds(): Iterable&lt;string&gt;</code>**

Returns an iterable of all organization IDs that have services initialized.

### processRequest()

**<code>processRequest(goatReq: GoatRequest&lt;&gt;, info: ServeHandlerInfo): Promise&lt;Response&lt;&gt;&gt;</code>**

Processes an incoming HTTP request through the server's middleware and
endpoint pipeline.

### registerEndpoint()

**<code>registerEndpoint(ep: Endpoint&lt;US&gt;): void</code>**

Registers an endpoint handler with the server.

### registerMiddleware()

**<code>registerMiddleware(mid: Middleware&lt;US&gt;): void</code>**

Registers a middleware handler with the server.

### servicesForOrganization()

**<code>servicesForOrganization(orgId: string): Promise&lt;[ServerServices](/docs/api/interfaces/serverservices)&lt;US&gt;&gt;</code>**

Gets or creates server services for a given organization ID.

This method manages the lifecycle of server services for each organization,
creating them on first access and caching them for subsequent requests.

### start()

**<code>start(): Promise&lt;void&gt;</code>**

Starts the server and all associated services.

### stop()

**<code>stop(): Promise&lt;void&gt;</code>**

Gracefully stops the server and all its services.
Safe to call multiple times.

### updateStaticAssets()

**<code>updateStaticAssets(assets: StaticAssets): void</code>**

Updates the static assets configuration for the server and all existing
organization services.

This is primarily used by the live-reload debug server functionality to
update static assets without requiring a full server restart.

# JSONLogStream

A LogStream implementation that writes log entries to a JSON file.
Supports optional throttling to reduce the number of entries written.

**Implements:** [LogStream](/docs/api/interfaces/logstream)

## Constructor

**<code>new JSONLogStream(path: string, throttleRate: number)</code>**

Creates a new JSONLogStream

## Methods

### appendEntry()

**<code>appendEntry(e: NormalizedLogEntry&lt;LogEntry&gt;): Promise&lt;void&gt;</code>**

Appends a log entry to the JSON file, respecting the throttle rate

### close()

**<code>close(): Promise&lt;void&gt;</code>**

Closes the JSON log file if it's open. This is handled automatically by the
stream and there's no need to call it explicitly under normal operation.

You may want to call this explicitly when:
- You need to ensure logs are flushed to disk immediately
- You're shutting down the application and want to clean up resources
- You want to release the file handle before the automatic timeout

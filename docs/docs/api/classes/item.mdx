# Item

An Item instance represents a snapshot of a data item including all of its
fields. An item is a map like object that tracks both the data and its
schema. Items are the contents of specific versions (commits) in the version
graph (history).

Typically you never need to create instances of this class directly. Instead,
use `GoatDB.item()` in order to get a LiveItem instance that's much easier
to work with.

**Implements:** [ReadonlyItem](../interfaces/readonlyitem), [Encodable](../interfaces/encodable)

## Constructor

```typescript
new Item(config: `ItemConfig`<S> | `ConstructorDecoderConfig`<`EncodedItem`>, registry: [DataRegistry](./classes/dataregistry)<>)
```

Creates a new Item instance.

## Methods

### assertValidData()

```typescript
assertValidData(): void
```

Asserts that the item's data is valid according to its schema.

This method checks if the item's data conforms to the schema's
requirements. If the data is invalid, it throws an assertion error with
the corresponding error message.

### clone()

```typescript
clone(): [Item](./classes/item)<S>
```

Clones the current item.

This method creates a new Item instance with the same schema and data as
the current item. The new item is a deep copy of the current item,
including all nested objects and arrays.

### cloneData()

```typescript
cloneData(onlyFields: unknown[]): `Readwrite`<`SchemaDataType`<S>>
```

Creates a deep copy of the item's data.

### copyFrom()

```typescript
copyFrom(doc: [Item](./classes/item)<S> | [ReadonlyItem](./interfaces/readonlyitem)<S>): void
```

Copies data from another item into this one.

This method replaces the current item's schema and data with a deep copy
of the source item's schema and data. The source item remains unchanged.

### dataUnsafe()

```typescript
dataUnsafe(): `SchemaDataType`<S>
```

WARNING: You probably shouldn't use this. Used internally as an
optimization to avoid unnecessary copying.

### delete()

```typescript
delete(key: T): boolean
```

Deletes a given field from this item.

### deserialize()

```typescript
deserialize(decoder: `Decoder`<string, `DecodedValue`>): void
```

Deserializes an encoded item into this instance.

This method decodes the item's schema, data, normalization status and
checksum from an encoded format and updates this instance's state
accordingly. The item is automatically normalized after deserialization.

### diff()

```typescript
diff(other: [Item](./classes/item)<S>, byCharacter: boolean): `DataChanges`<>
```

Computes the differences between this item and another item.

This method compares the data of this item with another item of the same schema
and returns an object describing the differences between them.

### diffKeys()

```typescript
diffKeys(other: [Item](./classes/item)<S>, local: boolean): string[]
```

Returns an array of field keys that differ between this item and another
item.

This method compares the data of this item with another item of the same
schema and returns an array of field keys where the values differ.

This is a much faster check than a full diff computation.

### get()

```typescript
get(key: T): unknown
```

Returns the value for the given field or undefined.

If this is a null item (has no schema), returns undefined for all fields.
Otherwise, returns the field's value, or undefined if not set.

### has()

```typescript
has(key: T): boolean
```

Returns whether the given field is present on the current item or not.

### isEqual()

```typescript
isEqual(other: [Item](./classes/item)<S>): boolean
```

Compares this item with another item for equality.
Two items are considered equal if they have the same schema and their data
is equal after normalization.

### lock()

```typescript
lock(): void
```

Locks this item, preventing any further modifications.

When an item is locked, attempts to modify its data will throw errors.
The checksum is calculated and cached before locking to ensure consistency.
Items are typically locked when they represent a specific version in
history.

### needsSchemaUpgrade()

```typescript
needsSchemaUpgrade(): boolean
```

Checks if this item needs a schema upgrade.

This method checks if there is a newer schema version available for this
item's  namespace. It compares the item's current schema version with the
latest schema version registered in the schema manager.

### normalize()

```typescript
normalize(): void
```

Normalizes the item's data according to its schema.

This method ensures that all fields in the item's data conform to the
schema's requirements by applying normalization rules. For example, it may:
- Convert field values to their proper types
- Apply default values for missing required fields
- Remove fields not defined in the schema

The normalization is only performed once - subsequent calls will have no
effect. Null items (those with a null schema) are always normalized by
definition.

### patch()

```typescript
patch(changes: `DataChanges`<>): void
```

Applies changes to this item's data.

This method takes a DataChanges object (typically produced by the diff()
method) and applies those changes to this item's data. The item's data
will be modified in place.

### serialize()

```typescript
serialize(encoder: [Encoder](./interfaces/encoder)<string, `CoreValue`, `CoreValue`, unknown>, options: unknown): void
```

Serializes the item into an encoded format.

This method encodes the item's schema, data, normalization status and
checksum into a format that can be stored or transmitted. The item is
automatically normalized before serialization.

### set()

```typescript
set(key: T, value: unknown): void
```

Sets the value for the given field.

### setMulti()

```typescript
setMulti(data: `Partial<`SchemaDataType`<S>>`): void
```

A convenience method for setting several fields and values at once.

### toJS()

```typescript
toJS(local: boolean): [ReadonlyJSONObject](./interfaces/readonlyjsonobject)
```

Serializes this item to a JSON-compatible object.

### unlock()

```typescript
unlock(): void
```

Unlocks this item, allowing modifications.

When an item is unlocked, its data can be modified. This reverses the
effect of calling lock().

WARNING: Unlocking items is dangerous and should never be needed in normal
usage. Unlocking can corrupt historical versions and lead to serious data
inconsistencies.

### upgradeSchema()

```typescript
upgradeSchema(newSchema: `Schema`): boolean
```

Upgrades this item's data to a newer schema version.

This method takes an optional target schema and attempts to upgrade the
item's data to match that schema. If no target schema is provided, it will
upgrade to the latest schema version available for this namespace.

The upgrade process is performed by applying the upgrade functions defined
in each schema version between the current and target versions. The upgrade
will fail if any intermediate schema versions are missing.

### validate()

```typescript
validate(): unknown
```

Validates the item's data against its schema.

This method checks if the item's data conforms to the schema's
requirements and returns the validation result.

### fromJS()

```typescript
fromJS(obj: [ReadonlyJSONObject](./interfaces/readonlyjsonobject)): [Item](./classes/item)<S>
```

Deserializes a JSON-compatible object into an Item instance.

### nullItem()

```typescript
nullItem(registry: [DataRegistry](./classes/dataregistry)<>): [Item](./classes/item)<S>
```

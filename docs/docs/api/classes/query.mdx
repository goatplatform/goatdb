# Query

A Query represents a live view over a repository or another query,
supporting:

- Query chaining: Queries can be chained together, where one query's results
  become the input for another query. This allows building complex data
  transformations through composition.

- Incremental updates: When the underlying data changes, queries
  automatically update their results. Changes propagate efficiently through
  query chains - only the affected results are recomputed rather than
  re-running the entire query.

- Persistent caching: Results are continuously cached to disk, both during
  the initial linear scan and as the source data changes. This allows
  queries to be efficiently resumed after being suspended or closed,
  without having to re-scan the entire dataset.

- Efficient indexing: When sorted by a field, queries act as persistent indexes
  enabling O(log n) lookups on that field. The index stays up-to-date as data
  changes and results are cached for immediate availability.

Query chaining example:
```ts
// Chain queries to find recent important todos
const importantTodos = new Query({
  source: repo,
  predicate: todo => todo.important
});
const recentImportant = new Query({
  source: importantTodos,
  predicate: todo => isRecent(todo.date)
});
```

You can also use queries as efficient indexes:
```ts
// Create an index over user emails
const usersByEmail = new Query({
  source: '/sys/users',
  schema: kSchemaUser,
  sortBy: 'email'
});

// O(log n) lookup by email after index is built
await usersByEmail.loadingFinished();
const user = usersByEmail.find('email', 'user@example.com');
```

**Extends:** [Emitter](./emitter)

## Constructor

```typescript
new Query(config: `QueryConfig`<`IS`, `OS`, `CTX`>)
```

Creates a new Query instance.

## Methods

### close()

```typescript
close(): void
```

Closes this query and cleans up its resources. This:
- Emits a 'Closed' event
- Unregisters from query persistence to stop caching
- Removes source change listeners
- Marks the query as closed

Once closed, a query cannot be reopened. Create a new query instance
instead.

### entries()

```typescript
entries(): `Generator`<`Entry`<`OS`>, any, unknown>
```

Returns a generator that yields key-value pairs for all items in the query
results. Each entry contains the item's path key and its corresponding
value.

### find()

```typescript
find(fieldName: unknown, value: unknown): [ManagedItem](./classes/manageditem)<`OS`, `Schema`>
```

Finds the first item in the query results where the specified field matches
the given value. If the field is the sort field, uses binary search for
O(log n) lookup. Otherwise performs a linear scan.

### has()

```typescript
has(path: string): boolean
```

Checks if a given path is included in the query results.

### loadingFinished()

```typescript
loadingFinished(): `Promise`<unknown>
```

Returns a promise that resolves to true when the query finishes loading
its initial results. If loading is already finished, the promise resolves
on the next event loop cycle.

### onLoadingFinished()

```typescript
onLoadingFinished(handler: unknown): unknown
```

Registers a callback to be invoked when the query finishes loading its
initial results. If loading is already finished, the callback will be
scheduled to run on the next event loop cycle.

### onResultsChanged()

```typescript
onResultsChanged(handler: unknown): unknown
```

Registers a callback to be invoked when the query results change due to
updates in the underlying data source.

### paths()

```typescript
paths(): `Iterable`<string>
```

Gets an iterable of all paths included in the query results.

### results()

```typescript
results(): unknown
```

Gets the results of the query as an array of managed items. The returned
items are mutable - any changes made to them will automatically trigger the
query to update its results.

### resume()

```typescript
resume(): `Promise`<void>
```

### suspend()

```typescript
suspend(): void
```

### valueForPath()

```typescript
valueForPath(key: string): [Item](./classes/item)<`OS`>
```

Gets the item value for a given path key. The value is retrieved from the
repository's committed head or temporary records.

# BaseTimer

An application level timer that internally uses a single setTimeout.
This enables holding thousands of active timers without overloading the
JS event loop.

**Implements:** [Timer](/api/interfaces/timer)

**Subclasses:** [BaseDynamicTimer](/api/classes/basedynamictimer), [SimpleTimer](/api/classes/simpletimer)

## Constructor

**<code>new BaseTimer(callback: [TimerCallback](/api/interfaces/timercallback), label: string)</code>**

Creates a new timer instance.

## Methods

### calcNextFireDate()

**<code>calcNextFireDate(): number</code>**

Calculates the next timestamp in milliseconds when this timer should fire.
This is called internally by schedule() to determine when to fire the
timer.

### compare()

**<code>compare(other: [BaseTimer](/api/classes/basetimer)&lt;&gt;): number</code>**

Compares this timer with another timer to determine their relative order.
Used for sorting timers in the scheduler queue.

### fire()

**<code>fire(): void</code>**

Fires the timer and handles rescheduling if necessary.
This method is called internally by the timer system when the timer's
scheduled time has elapsed.

### reset()

**<code>reset(): [Timer](/api/interfaces/timer)</code>**

Resets the timer to fire at the next appropriate time.
If the timer is not currently scheduled, this is a no-op.

### run()

**<code>run(): boolean</code>**

Executes the timer's callback and handles rescheduling if necessary.

### schedule()

**<code>schedule(): [Timer](/api/interfaces/timer)</code>**

Schedules this timer to fire at the next appropriate time.
If the timer is already scheduled, this is a no-op.

### unschedule()

**<code>unschedule(): [Timer](/api/interfaces/timer)</code>**

Unschedules this timer if it is currently scheduled.
If the timer is not scheduled, this is a no-op.

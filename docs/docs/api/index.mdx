# API Reference

Complete API documentation for GoatDB.

## Core

GoatDB: An Embedded, Distributed, Document Database

GoatDB is a real-time, version-controlled database for Deno, React, and
low-friction deployments. It excels at real-time collaboration and
embedded caching applications while prioritizing speed and developer
experience.

Key Features:
- No Dedicated Infra: Run the entire DB client-side, with incremental queries
- Resilience & Offline-First: Clients keep working if server goes down
- Edge-Native: Most processing happens in the client
- Real-Time Collaboration: Built-in sync keeps state synchronized
- Distributed Version Control: Leverages concepts from DVCS with bloom
                               filter-based synchronization
- Automatic Conflict Resolution: Uses ephemeral CRDTs for efficient
                                 real-time conflict resolution
- Application-Level Sharding: Natural scalability for multi-user applications

## Server

This module exposes APIs for controlling the GoatDB server. It includes
functions for running the interactive debug server and for compiling a
standalone server executable.

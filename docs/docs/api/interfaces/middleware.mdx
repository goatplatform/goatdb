# Middleware

A middleware runs before and/or after the selected endpoint. A middleware
may either block the request entirely (to enforce permissions, etc) or modify
the response after the endpoint finished execution.

Note that all registered middlewares get a chance to run for each request.
Execution order follows registration order, just like endpoints.

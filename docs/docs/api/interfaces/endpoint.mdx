# Endpoint

An Endpoint catches a request using its filter, and generates an appropriate
response for the request. For every incoming request, all Endpoints are
searched until the first filter hit is found. Thus, the order of Endpoint
registration determines the search order.

In order to fulfill their job, Endpoints can consume Services offered by the
server. See `BaseService` below.

## Methods

### filter()

**<code>filter(services: [ServerServices](/api/interfaces/serverservices)&lt;US&gt;, req: GoatRequest&lt;&gt;, info: ServeHandlerInfo): boolean</code>**

### processRequest()

**<code>processRequest(services: [ServerServices](/api/interfaces/serverservices)&lt;US&gt;, req: GoatRequest&lt;&gt;, info: ServeHandlerInfo): Promise&lt;Response&lt;&gt;&gt;</code>**

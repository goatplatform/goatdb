[GoatDB](https://goatdb.dev/) is an embedded, [distributed](/architecture),
document database that prioritizes [speed](/benchmarks) and
[developer experience](/tutorial/). It excels at real-time collaboration and
embedded caching applications.

Instead of following traditional database design patterns, GoatDB leverages
[concepts](/concepts) refined over decades by distributed version control
systems. These are enhanced with novel algorithms
([bloom filter-based synchronization](/sync/) and
[ephemeral CRDTs](/conflict-resolution)) for efficient [synchronization](/sync)
and automatic real-time conflict resolution.

Currently optimized for TypeScript environments, GoatDB functions as a
first-class citizen in both browsers and servers. It utilizes a
[document model](/concepts) with [schemas](/schema), providing
[causal eventual consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_consistency)
to simplify development while offering built-in optional
[cryptographic signing](/sessions) for the underlying
[commit graph](/commit-graph).

GoatDB implements [incremental local queries](/query), leveraging its version
control internals to efficiently process only changed documents.

GoatDB employs a [memory-first design](/repositories) and a different
[scaling approach](/repositories) than traditional databases. Rather than
growing a single large database, it uses application-level sharding with
multiple medium-sized [repositories](/repositories) that [sync](/sync)
independently. Each user or data group has its own [repository](/repositories),
enabling horizontal scaling and efficient client-server
[synchronization](/sync). This [architecture](/architecture) provides natural
scalability for multi-user applications without complex manual sharding.

Items in [GoatDB](https://goatdb.dev/) are defined alongside their
[schema](/schema). Schemas dictate both the field types and their
[conflict resolution](/conflict-resolution) strategy. [Schemas](/schema) are
themselves versioned, making rolling schema updates via branches a natural
mechanism.

Please keep in mind that [GoatDB](https://goatdb.dev/) is still under active
development and therefore full backward compatibility is not guaranteed before
reaching v1.0.0.

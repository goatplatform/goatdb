# React Functions

## useDB

**<code>useDB(): [GoatDB](/api/classes/goatdb)&lt;US&gt;</code>**

Opens a local DB, creating it if necessary. Once opened, the DB is available
as a react context. All future calls return the already opened DB rather than
opening it again.

This hook will trigger a re-render whenever the current user changes.

## useDBReady

**<code>useDBReady(): [DBReadyState](/api/types/dbreadystate)</code>**

A hook for monitoring the DB's loading process. The hook triggers whenever
the loading process changes its state.

## useItem

**<code>useItem(pathComps: string[]): [ManagedItem](/api/classes/manageditem)&lt;S, [Schema](/api/types/schema)&gt;</code>**

This hook monitors changes to a specific item, triggering a re-render
whenever the item's state changes. It returns a mutable ManagedItem
instance that allows direct editing. Any changes to the item are
automatically queued for background commit and synchronization with the
server. Similar to the useQuery hook, useItem reacts to both
local and remote updates.

## useQuery

**<code>useQuery(config: [UseQueryOpts](/api/interfaces/usequeryopts)&lt;IS, CTX, OS&gt;): [Query](/api/classes/query)&lt;IS, OS, CTX&gt;</code>**

Creates a new query or retrieves an existing one. On first access, GoatDB
automatically loads the source repository either from the local disk or by
fetching it from the server. The hook triggers UI re-rendering whenever the
query results are updated, regardless of whether the changes originate from
local or remote edits.

When a query is first opened, it performs a linear scan of its source using a
Coroutine without blocking the main thread. During and after this
initial scan, the query caches its results to disk, allowing subsequent runs
to resume execution from the cached state.

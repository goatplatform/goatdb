# ManagedItem

A high-level interface for reading, writing, and synchronizing a single item
in GoatDB. Manages the item's state, schema validation, and version history.

**Extends:** [Emitter](/api/classes/emitter)

## Constructor

**<code>new ManagedItem(db: [GoatDB](/api/classes/goatdb)&lt;US&gt;, path: string)</code>**

## Methods

### activate()

**<code>activate(): void</code>**

Activates the managed item by attaching a document change listener to the
repository. When the document changes, it will trigger a rebase of the item
to sync with the latest version. This method is idempotent - calling it
multiple times will only attach one listener.

Note: This is an internal method used by GoatDB and should not be called
directly by users.

### commit()

**<code>commit(): Promise&lt;void&gt;</code>**

Commits the current state of this item to the database.

This method:
1. Normalizes and validates the item
2. In debug mode, asserts that the item is valid
3. In non-debug mode, silently returns if the item is invalid
4. Cancels any pending delayed commits
5. If a commit is already in progress, waits for it to complete before retrying
6. Executes the commit

### deactivate()

**<code>deactivate(): void</code>**

Deactivates the managed item by removing the document change listener and
canceling any pending commits. This method is idempotent - calling it
multiple times has no additional effect.

Note: This is an internal method used by GoatDB and should not be called
directly by users.

### delete()

**<code>delete(key: any): boolean</code>**

Deletes a key-value pair from this item. If the field has a default value
defined in the schema, the field will be set to that default value instead
of being deleted.

### downloadDebugGraph()

**<code>downloadDebugGraph(): void</code>**

Downloads a debug graph visualization of the item's network state.
The downloaded file is in a format compatible with Cytoscape, a network
visualization and analysis tool.

### get()

**<code>get(key: any): [SchemaDataType](/api/types/schemadatatype)&lt;S&gt;[K]</code>**

Gets the value for the given key from this item.

### has()

**<code>has(key: any): boolean</code>**

Checks if this item has a value for the given key.

### readyPromise()

**<code>readyPromise(): Promise&lt;void&gt;</code>**

Returns a promise that resolves when this managed item is ready to use.
If the item is already ready, the promise resolves immediately.

### rebase()

**<code>rebase(): void</code>**

Synchronizes the local item state with the latest version from the
repository.

Similar to git rebase, this merges any remote changes into the local
in-memory state.

### set()

**<code>set(key: any, value: [SchemaDataType](/api/types/schemadatatype)&lt;S&gt;[T]): void</code>**

Sets the value for the given key in this item.

### setMulti()

**<code>setMulti(data: Partial&lt;[SchemaDataType](/api/types/schemadatatype)&lt;S&gt;&gt;): void</code>**

A convenience method for setting several fields and values at once.
